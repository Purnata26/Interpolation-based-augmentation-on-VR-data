To predict cybersickness accurately, a significant amount
of data is necessary due to subjective nature of cybersickness.
Individuals may experience cybersickness symptoms differently.
Therefore, a large dataset encompassing a wide range of individuals
with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and sensitivities is necessary
to capture this variability and train predictive models effectively.
Additionally, gathering data on cybersickness typically involves
conducting user studies, which can be resource-intensive and
time-consuming. To ease the burden of data collection for training
for predictive models, data augmentation techniques can enhance
model performance by increasing volume of data. However,
the optimal approach to augmenting cybersickness data remains
uncertain. We utilized a publicly accessible dataset ’Simulations
2021’, incorporating heart rate (HR), eye tracking, and electrodermal
activity (EDA) data for cybersickness prediction both with and
without augmentation to check the performance of augmentation.
